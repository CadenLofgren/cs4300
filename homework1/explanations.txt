1. A simple test program to write out hello world. With a test script to check the string.

2. A file to test different data types such as int, float, string, and boolean.

3. A file for three purposes. To check if a number is positive, negative, or zero. A for loop to print first 10 prime numbers. A loop to find sum of all numbers from 1 - 100.
The test cases for the first and third purposes were not difficult. The prime number one was the hardest.

4. A file to calculate the discount and price of item after discount of given fields. Using isinstance to verify the given fields.
The test cases cover ints, floats, and other invalid inputs.

5. A file to list favorite books along with their authors. Using list separation, the first three tuples were placed into a separate variable.
The students were a dictionary with student names and id's. The tests looked for the length of the list and the specifics of a certain spot in the list.
The students test checked if Caden Lofgren was in the list and the ID number associated with John Doe.

6. I wrote this file to open the txt file and read in the text to determine how many words were in this file. I had a problem with the location of the txt file so it couldn't read it.


7. I wrote a file to check the mean of the list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The check performed the calculation. I tried using numpy for this but it kept giving the error that numpy couldn't be found. I installed it but for some reason it wouldn't work. I am sorry.
